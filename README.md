# PHD: Vision-based Passenger Head Detection for Carriage Crowd Density Estimation
The PHD dataset consists to date of 3717 images and 67215 annotations. 
The main motivation for the creation of the dataset was the lack of domain-specific data. 
This dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from Baidu Netdisk (link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1tosPhWH50JozOaI3RaKSEQ, access code: wsda).
